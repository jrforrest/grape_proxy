1. main_spec.rb:25-37 is gross
2. Race condition between Cache#get->Cache#set with DbCache needs transaction
3. Lots of repeated logic in main_spec
4. Expectations on sends in main_spec fail on server thread which results in
   spec failure messages not propogating to reporter.
5. Kernel.sleep is used to wait on the testing server to start on spec runs.
   there's got to be a better way of blocking on that (maybe flip a semaphore
   in config.ru?)
6. Re-entrant usage of Proxy's http and cache objects from specs for
   assertions on cache size and http message receives and such is pretty
   ugly and possibly prone to synchronization issues.  Async observers
   would probably be a cleaner approach.
